                        The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly transforming
                        various
                        sectors, including Finance, Accounting, Management and Energy (FAME). This
                        transformation is
                        not merely technological; it also encompasses profound implications for Environmental,
                        Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks. The integration of AI into these sectors
                        presents
                        both opportunities and challenges that need to be critically examined.
